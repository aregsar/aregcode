My name is Areg Sarkissian and I am a principal .NET Software Architect specializing in Domain Driven Design and Microservices based enterprise application development.

I am a veteran of America Online, Autobytel, Walt Disney Company and Corporate Travel Management where I helped these companies develop and deploy complex distributed systems and applications.

This blog is where I write technical articles about .NET development.
