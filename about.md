# About Me

I am principal software architect specializing in ASP.NET Core, Spring Boot and Laravel enterprise web application architecture and development.

In the past I have developed mission critical software for organizations as diverse as America Online, Autobytel and Walt Disney.

I helped these organizations design robust, testable and maintainable application code and mentored development teams on enterprise software development best practices.

I strive to use immutable, composable, stateless and side effect free code to make code easy to reason about, reduce cognitive load, reduce the need for debugging and make testing easier.

I am a proponent of the following in no particular order:

Kanban
WIP limits
Pomodoro technique
Continious delivery
Vertical slice architecture
Immutable value objects
Immutable Infrastructure
Functional programming
Functional testing
Command Query Separation
One way data binding
Redux

I am also a big fan of Bertrand Meyer the inventor of the Eiffel programming language and the concepts of design by contract and command quey separation.
