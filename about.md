# About Me

I am a principal software architect specializing in ASP.NET Core, Spring Boot and Laravel enterprise web application architecture and development.

In the past I have developed mission critical software for organizations as diverse as America Online, Autobytel and Walt Disney.

I helped these organizations design robust, testable and maintainable application code and mentored development teams on enterprise software development best practices.

I strive to pragmatically use immutable, composable, stateless and side effect free code to make code easy to reason about and make code easy to test and debug.

I am a proponent of the following concepts that help efficiently deliver reliable code:

+ Kanban
+ WIP limits
+ Pomodoro technique
+ Continious delivery
+ Command line tooling
+ Vertical slice architecture
+ Immutable value objects
+ Immutable Infrastructure
+ Functional programming
+ Functional testing
+ Command Query Separation
+ One way data binding
+ Redux data flow

Currently I am working on command line tooling to improve the developer experience of infrastructure provisioning and application deployment on the Digital Ocean platform.

I am also working on __Docker__ based tooling and code scaffolding tools to improve the development experience for web developers.
